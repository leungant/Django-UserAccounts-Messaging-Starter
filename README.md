# Django site with user login, messaging and message notifications


Django project with


1) Login with self-hosted (email-based) auth and auth via fb, gmail etc, 
2) User-user messages 
3) New message notification ability



## Versions/branches

- Master    Authentication, user logins only on master
- Add-Django-Notifictaions    with messaging and notifications




## Motivation

One of the non-profit projects we were working with needed a Django set up that could handle user-user messages and a pollable notification mechanism for those messages. Django is not traditionally developed for a social network style application, but this is an example implementation of how this functionality might be provided. Feel free to use as a base for other projects.
