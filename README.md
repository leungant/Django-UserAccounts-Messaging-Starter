## Story

One of the non-profit projects we were working with needed a Django set up that could handle user-user messages and a pollable notification mechanism for those messages. This is an example implementation of how this functionality could be provided even though this may not be traditionally where Django's main focus has been. Feel free to use as a base for other projects - or drop us a line if there are any new up-to-date Django messaging modules!
